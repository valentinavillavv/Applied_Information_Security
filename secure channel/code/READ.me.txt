Instructions to use client-server:
    * It is required that the user has installed python to its OS
    * Instruction `python3` can differ across different OS,
      based on your instalation of python.
      E.g: on Windows it can be `py`
      
    i)  Start server with command:
        `python3 server.py`
    ii) Start client with commands:
        `python3 client.py <command> <hostname> <port>`
        example:
        `python3 client.py "ls -a" 'localhost' 7007`
    iii) To terminate the connection:
        In client CLI type `exit`.
